This is the source code for our NES416 / Network Programming course Assignment #3.

## Overview
Console program that create a socket and print the default values of the socket options. Furthermore, it
should take two integers from user and assign them to SO_SNDLOWAT and SO_RCVLOWAT options.

## Requirments
Attach screenshots of running program output. User input in screenshots should make sense.


## Quoting from Dr.Raed documet:
> The output of your program should first display the name of your operating system, release and version.
> Then, you need to display the name of the option, and its default value for all options.
> Furthermore, if the option is not supported, you need to indicate that also.
> At the end you should ask users to enter values for the receive low-water mark and the send low-water mark
> for a TCP socket, modify them, and display the new values on the screen. An example showing only the option
> setting might look like:

> -- Prompt$ Please enter new values for the receive low-water mark and the send low-water mark for TCP: --
>
> -- xx yy (where xx yy are user input such that xx is the send low-water mark and yy is the receive low-water mark) --
>
> -- Modified send low-water mark (TCP): xx --
>
> Modified receive low-water mark (TCP): yy
